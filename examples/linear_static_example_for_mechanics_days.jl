# The whole idea of the JuliaFEM input is to be a normal Julia script, where the
# user can freely define any functions needed to perform the task. Here we

# we previously defined the radius to be 6.0, which means (0,[44,56],0). In other

# and 56. This function will edit mesh object and add node set called `:mid_fixed` to it.

# Those will be added to the same set `:mid_fixed`.

# Let's write resuls to Xdmf file

# do this automatically, see issue #203)

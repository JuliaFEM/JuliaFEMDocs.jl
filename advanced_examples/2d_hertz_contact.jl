# # 2D Hertz contact problem

# ![](2d_hertz_contact/model.png)

# In the example, a cylinder is pressed agains block with a force of 35 kN.
# A similar example can be found from NAFEMS report FENET D3613 (advanced
# finite element contact benchmarks).
#
# Solution for maximum pressure ``p_0`` and contact radius ``a`` is
# ```math
#   p_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{FE}{2\pi R}}, \\
#   a     = \sqrt{\frac{8FR}{\pi E}},
# ```
# where
#
# ```math
#   E = \frac{2E_{1}E_{2}}{E_{2}\left(1-\nu_{1}^{2}\right)+E_{1}\left(1-\nu_{2}^{2}\right)}.
# ```
#
# Substituting values, one gets accurate solution to be ``p_0 = 3585 \;\mathrm{MPa}`` and
# ``a = 6.21 \;\mathrm{mm}``.

# Simulation starts by reading the mesh. Model is constructed and meshed using
# SALOME, thus mesh format is .med. Mesh type is quite simple structure,
# containing things like `mesh.nodes`, `mesh.elements` and so on. Keep on mind,
# that Mesh contains only standard Julia types and we think it as a structure
# helping us to construct elements needed in simulation. In principle, we don't
# need to use `Mesh` in simulation anyway if we figure some other way to define
# the geometry for elements.

# Next, define two bodies. Technically, we could have only one problem and add
# elements from both bodies to the same problem, but defining two different
# problems is recommended for clarity. Plain strain assumption is used.
# To make clear what is happening here: we first create a set of elements
# (elements are in vector called `upper_elements`), then we define new
# problem which type is `Elasticity`, give it some meaningful name (this time
# `cylinder`), and last value 2 means that problems does have two degrees of
# freedom per node.

# Next we define some boundary conditions: creating "boundary" problems goes
# in the same way than defining "field" problems, the only difference is that
# we add extra argument giving what field are we tring to fix. This time,
# we have 2 dofs / node and we fix displacement in direction 2.

# Next we define point load. To define that, we first need to find some node
# near the top of cylinder, using function `find_nearest_node`. Then we create
# a new problem, again of type Elasticity. Like told already, we don't need to
# use `Mesh` if we have some other procedure to define the geometry of the
# element (and it's connectivity, of course). So we can directly create an
# element of type `Poi1`, meaning 1-node point element, update it's geometry
# and apply 35.0e3 kN load in negative y-direction:

nid = find_nearest_node(mesh, [0.0, 100.0])

# Next, we define another boudary problem, this time the type of problem is
# Contact2D, which is a mortar contact formulation for two dimensions.
# Elements are added using `add_slave_elements!` and `add_master_elements!`.
# Problems, in general, can have some properties defined, like the formulation
# in `Elasticity` (we also have `:plane_stress`). For contact, we need to swap
# normal direction for meshes created by SALOME because in Code Aster, element
# orientation is defined opposite to what is used in ABAQUS, and in JuliaFEM in
# general we follow the same conventions what are used in ABAQUS.

# After all problems are defined, we define some `Analysis`, which can be e.g.
# static analysis, dynamic analysis, modal analysis, linear perturbation
# analysis and so on. Here, the analysis type is `Nonlinear`, which is nonlinear
# quasistatic analysis. In the same manner as we do `add_elements!` to add
# elements to `Problem`, we use `add_problems!` to add problems to analysis.
# Because we are not restricted to some particular input and output formats,
# we "connect" a `ResultsWriter` to our analysis, this time we want to visualize
# results using ParaView, thus we write our results to Xdmf format, which uses
# well defined standards XML and HDF to store model data.
